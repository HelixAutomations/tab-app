The Respondents have since launched a new product line, conceived and developed during my tenure, and appear to have spun out a separate entity to exploit it commercially. I have had no involvement in this despite my co-founding role.

A hearing took place in July 2025, and a Case Management Conference is listed for February 2026. The petition has been served, the Respondents have filed their points of defence, and I have submitted a detailed reply. I have also made applications for disclosure and expedition.

I’m seeking urgent legal support, ideally under a no-win, no-fee or deferred fee arrangement based on the strength and value of the claim.

And the builders they used didn''t seem professional and worked in heavy rain. \nI also seek compensation for damages delays and all other aspects. They Did agree to 15k but refusing it now. \n \nRegards\nArslan\n \n \n \n \nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am writing to formally address ongoing issues with the external wall insulation (EWI) work carried out at my property, 12 Newark Road, Luton, LU4 8LD, under a government grant scheme, by Elansworth LTD/NextRecycle. Despite multiple complaints over the past nearly three years, the work remains incomplete, substandard, and has caused significant damage to my property. Furthermore, the company has failed to honor a written agreement to pay £15,000 in compensation for these issues, as confirmed via WhatsApp by the owner, who has since blocked my number and ignored further communications. As this has not been met in reasonable manner of time, I will be seeking my further rights in compensation etc. \nDetails of the Complaint\nIncomplete and Substandard Work\n: The EWI project, initiated nearly three years ago, remains unfinished despite repeated complaints. The contractors have performed partial work on multiple occasions, leaving the job incomplete and of poor quality, failing to meet industry standards.\nProperty Damage\n: During the course of the work, my property sustained damages.\nLack of Documentation\n: No plans, drawings, or material specifications were provided for the EWI work, leaving me without clarity on the scope or standards of the project.\nUnqualified Personnel\n: On at least one occasion, a non-registered gas engineer was sent to perform work, with a registered engineer following up later, indicating non-compliance with regulatory requirements.\nInvalid Guarantee\n: Provided guarantee paperwork over two years ago that was not signed off, reflecting incomplete work. Despite assurances that new guarantee paperwork would be issued, this has not been fulfilled. \nInadequate Assessments\n: Multiple assessors visited my property but failed to follow proper procedures, further delaying resolution.\nUnfulfilled Compensation Agreement\n: The owner agreed via WhatsApp to pay £15,000 in compensation for the issues caused. However, have since blocked my number and failed to honor this agreement.\nThis letter outlines the primary issues with the work performed. I reserve the right to raise additional claims as necessary\n \nI have raised these concerns directly with Elansworth LTD/NextRecycle via email and WhatsApp, as well as with NAPIT, the relevant certification body. Despite these efforts, no meaningful progress has been made to resolve the issues or honor the agreed compensation.\n·\n  \nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to services performed with reasonable care and skill, which your company has failed to provide.\n·\n \nNotice of Legal Action\nShould you fail to respond satisfactorily or meet these demands within 7 days of the date of this letter (by July 16, 2025), I will have no choice but to escalate this matter. This may include, but is not limited to: \n·\n  \nFiling a claim in the County Court for breach of contract, negligence, and damages.\nReporting the company to relevant authorities, including Trading Standards, the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme administrators, and other regulatory bodies overseeing government-funded insulation schemes.\nSeeking further legal advice to pursue compensation for all losses incurred, including additional costs for remedial work and legal fees.\n \nResponse Requested
