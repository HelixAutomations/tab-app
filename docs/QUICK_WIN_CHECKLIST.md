## ‚ö° 5-Minute Quick Wins

### 1. Database Cleanup Execution
**Impact**: Remove 67% of test data noise  
**Effort**: 5 minutes  
**Risk**: Low (backup plan documented)

```sql
-- Execute this single query
DELETE FROM Instructions 
WHERE (
    PaymentProduct LIKE '%Final test%'
    OR PaymentProduct LIKE '%Placeholder%' 
    OR PaymentProduct = 'test'
    OR (FirstName IS NULL AND LastName IS NULL AND PaymentProduct IS NULL)
    OR InstructionRef LIKE '%test%'
    OR InstructionRef = '27367-20200'
) AND InstructionRef != 'HLX-27367-94842';
```

### 2. Verify Luke Test Health  
**Impact**: Confirm system health indicator  
**Effort**: 1 minute  

```sql
SELECT * FROM Instructions WHERE InstructionRef = 'HLX-27367-94842';
-- Should show: Luke Test, proof-of-id-complete, paid
```

### 3. Test UI Performance
**Impact**: Confirm improved loading  
**Effort**: 2 minutes  

Visit Instructions tab - should load faster with clean data.

## üèó 30-Minute Projects

### 1. Automated Health Checks
**File**: `scripts/health-check.js`  
**Impact**: Prevent future data degradation  

```javascript
// Monitor Luke Test record health
// Alert if test data accumulates
// Verify unified endpoint performance
```

### 2. Data Governance Rules
**Impact**: Prevent test data accumulation  
Document patterns to avoid in production.

### 3. Clean Dataset Export
**Impact**: Reusable training data  
Export cleaned dataset for future deployments.
