# getUserData Migration Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## âœ… **What Was Done**

Successfully migrated `getUserData` from direct Azure Function call to Express server route.

### Files Changed:

1. **Created**:
   - `server/routes/userData.js` - New Express route with connection pooling and error handling

2. **Modified**:
   - `server/server.js` - Registered `/api/user-data` route
   - `src/index.tsx` - Updated to call `/api/user-data` instead of direct function
   - `src/app/functionality/FeContext.tsx` - Updated to call `/api/user-data` instead of direct function

3. **Documented**:
   - `docs/MIGRATION_getUserData.md` - Full migration documentation
   - `docs/API_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md` - Updated to reflect completion

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Matters for Teams Crashes**

### Before:
- Frontend called Azure Function directly on port 7072
- Bypassed Express server and all its middleware
- Inconsistent error handling
- No connection pooling
- Could cause CORS issues in Teams

### After:
- All requests go through Express server on port 8080
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Connection pooling with automatic retry
- Better timeout management
- Improved Teams reliability

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Steps**

1. **Build and start locally**:
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test in browser**:
   - Open http://localhost:8080
   - Check user data loads
   - Verify console logs show: `âœ… [userData] Found X user record(s)`

3. **Test in Teams**:
   - Open in Teams desktop app
   - Verify user data loads
   - Check no console errors
   - Test with slow network (throttle to 3G)

4. **Check server logs**:
   - Look for `âœ… [userData]` success messages
   - Verify response times < 1 second
   - No 500 errors

---

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Deploy**

The code is ready for deployment. After deployment:

1. Monitor server logs for `[userData]` messages
2. Watch for any 500/503/504 errors
3. Confirm user data loads in Teams (desktop and mobile)
4. If issues occur, see `docs/MIGRATION_getUserData.md` for rollback plan

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Impact**

- âœ… More consistent API behavior
- âœ… Better error handling in Teams
- âœ… Improved monitoring and debugging
- âœ… Reduced potential for CORS issues
- âœ… One less direct Azure Function dependency

**Next**: Test locally, then deploy to staging/production ðŸš€
