# üö® EMERGENCY SECURITY FIX CHECKLIST

## Critical Security Vulnerability Addressed
**Issue**: Database passwords were hardcoded in configuration files, exposing production credentials.

## Immediate Actions Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Replaced hardcoded passwords with Key Vault references in `az-appsettings-prod.json`
- [x] Replaced hardcoded passwords with Key Vault references in `az-appsettings-staging.json`  
- [x] Updated `api/local.settings.json` to use placeholder
- [x] Updated example file to remove real passwords
- [x] Created PowerShell script to setup Key Vault secrets

## URGENT Actions Required ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. Set Up Key Vault Secrets (IMMEDIATE)
```powershell
# Run this with NEW passwords (not the exposed ones):
.\setup-keyvault-secrets.ps1 -NewSqlPassword 'YOUR_NEW_SECURE_PASSWORD' -NewInstructionsPassword 'YOUR_NEW_INSTRUCTIONS_PASSWORD'
```

### 2. Deploy Updated App Settings (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Deploy to production
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group YOUR_RG --name YOUR_APP --settings @az-appsettings-prod.json

# Deploy to staging  
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group YOUR_RG --name YOUR_STAGING_APP --settings @az-appsettings-staging.json
```

### 3. Rotate Database Passwords (URGENT)
- **helix-database-server**: Change password from `3G3rt4Z5VuKHZbS` to new secure password
- **instructionsadmin**: Change password from `qG?-hTyfhsWE0,,}uJB,` to new secure password

### 4. Verify Key Vault Access (IMMEDIATE)
Ensure your App Service has the following permissions on Key Vault `helix-keys`:
- **Get** secrets permission
- **List** secrets permission (optional)

### 5. Test Applications (IMMEDIATE)
- Test production app can connect to database
- Test staging app can connect to database
- Test Azure Functions can connect to database

## Additional Security Issues Found üîç

### Stripe Payment Secrets Exposed
Files containing Stripe client secrets (should be reviewed):
- `src/tabs/instructions/ss.json` - Contains 4 client_secret values
- `src/tabs/instructions/mmm.json` - Contains 12+ client_secret values

**Action**: Review if these are test secrets or live secrets. If live, regenerate them.

### Files Still Containing Hardcoded Connection Strings
The following files build connection strings dynamically but may need review:
- `server/routes/attendance.js` (multiple instances)
- `api/src/functions/*.ts` (multiple functions)
- `enquiry-processing-v2/cta_processing.cs`

**Action**: Ensure these use environment variables, not hardcoded passwords.

## Security Best Practices Applied ‚úÖ

### Key Vault Integration
- Using `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)` syntax
- Separate secrets for production and staging
- Leveraging existing Key Vault: `helix-keys.vault.azure.net`

### Least Privilege Access
- App Service will use system-assigned managed identity
- Only **Get** permission required on Key Vault secrets

### Connection String Security
- Maintained encryption settings: `Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False`
- Kept connection timeouts and other security parameters

## Long-term Security Improvements üìã

### Immediate (Next 24 hours)
- [ ] Complete password rotation
- [ ] Test all applications
- [ ] Monitor for connection errors
- [ ] Review Stripe secrets

### Short-term (Next week)
- [ ] Add git pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
- [ ] Audit all configuration files for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Implement secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add Key Vault access logging/monitoring

### Medium-term (Next month)
- [ ] Implement secret rotation automation
- [ ] Add Key Vault secret versioning strategy
- [ ] Review and update security documentation
- [ ] Conduct security awareness training

## Monitoring & Alerts üìä

Set up alerts for:
- Key Vault access failures
- Database connection failures
- Unusual Key Vault access patterns
- Secret expiration warnings

## Emergency Contacts üìû

If issues arise during this fix:
1. Database Administrator - for password rotation
2. Azure Administrator - for Key Vault permissions  
3. DevOps Team - for application deployments
4. Security Team - for incident reporting

**Remember**: This was a critical security vulnerability. The exposed passwords were:
- `3G3rt4Z5VuKHZbS` (helix-database-server)
- `qG?-hTyfhsWE0,,}uJB,` (instructionsadmin)

These passwords were visible in source code and must be rotated immediately after the Key Vault setup is complete and tested.
