# Console Errors Resolution Log

## Date: September 6, 2025

### Errors Fixed

#### 1. ReactDOM.render Deprecation Warning
**Error**: `Warning: ReactDOM.render is no longer supported in React 18`
**Fix**: Migrated to `createRoot` API in `src/index.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### 2. Icon Re-registration Warnings  
**Error**: Multiple `initializeIcons()` calls causing registration warnings
**Fix**: Centralized icon initialization in `src/index.tsx`, removed duplicates
**Files Modified**: `Resources.tsx`, `Forms.tsx`, `Enquiries.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, `CustomTabs.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### 3. Performance Issues from Console Spam
**Error**: Excessive logging in prospect lookup causing performance degradation
**Fix**: Added caching with `useCallback` in `Instructions.tsx`, reduced logging
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### 4. Instructions Tab Logic Confusion
**Error**: Unclear separation between pitches and clients
**Fix**: Verified and documented correct filtering logic
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Performance Optimizations Applied

1. **Prospect Lookup Caching**: Implemented `useCallback` with cache
2. **Reduced Console Output**: Removed debug spam from render loops  
3. **Icon Initialization**: Centralized to prevent multiple registrations
