# Client History Implementation

## What's Been Implemented

### Enhanced Enquiry Overview
When viewing any enquiry, you now see:

1. **Current Enquiry Details** - All the existing information about the selected enquiry

2. **Client History Section** - A new section that automatically appears when there are previous enquiries from the same client

### Client History Features

#### Smart Client Matching
- **Primary**: Matches by email address (case-insensitive)
- **Fallback**: Matches by first name + last name combination
- **Automatic**: No manual grouping required

#### History Display
- Shows all previous enquiries from the same client
- Sorted by date (newest first)
- Displays:
  - Area of work and type
  - Enquiry date
  - Value (if available)
  - Enquiry ID
  - Clickable cards to switch between enquiries

#### Interactive Features
- **Click to Switch**: Click any history card to view that enquiry
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Count Display**: Shows total number of previous enquiries
- **Relationship Summary**: Displays total client relationship span

### Example Usage

**Luke Phillips Scenario:**
1. Click on Luke Phillips' latest enquiry (25 Jul 2024)
2. View current enquiry details in main section
3. See "Client History (1 previous enquiry)" section below
4. View his previous enquiry from 20 Jul 2024
5. Click the history card to switch to viewing the previous enquiry
6. Both enquiries show the full relationship context

### Test Data Added
- **Luke Phillips**: 2 enquiries (test-001, test-002)
- **Jane Smith**: 3 enquiries (test-003, test-004, test-005)  
- **Bob Wilson**: 1 enquiry (test-006) - no history section appears

### Benefits
- **Complete Context**: See full client relationship at a glance
- **Easy Navigation**: Switch between enquiries from same client
- **Historical Insight**: Understand client patterns and preferences
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing enquiry view without disruption

The implementation automatically detects when you're viewing an enquiry from a client with previous contact and shows their full correspondence history in an elegant, interactive format.
