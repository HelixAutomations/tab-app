# Unified Instruction + CCL Editor

The Helix editor merges instruction drafting with CCL generation in a single interface. It builds on `EnhancedPitchBuilderFeatures` for autosave, undo/redo and content statistics.

## Features

- Placeholder detection with live preview
- Visual indicator when all placeholders are completed
- Email header fields for follow up messages
- Instruction block editing panel for composable sections
- Optional assistant panel for quick prompt experiments

Use `HelixInstructionCCLDocumentEditor` from `src/tabs/instructions/components` to embed the editor in any page.
