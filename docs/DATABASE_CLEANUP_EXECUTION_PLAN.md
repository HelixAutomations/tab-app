## ðŸŽ¯ Cleanup Strategy

### Safe Deletion Criteria
```sql
-- Records matching ANY of these patterns will be deleted:
1. PaymentProduct LIKE '%Final test%'           -- 13 records
2. PaymentProduct LIKE '%Placeholder%'          -- 6 records  
3. PaymentProduct = 'test'                      -- 3 records
4. FirstName IS NULL AND LastName IS NULL       -- 8 records (empty)
5. InstructionRef LIKE '%test%'                 -- 1 record
6. InstructionRef = '27367-20200'               -- 1 record (malformed)

EXCEPTION: NEVER delete HLX-27367-94842 (Luke Test health indicator)
```

### Records to PRESERVE (15 total)
- **HLX-10001-10001**: Emma Example - Business Contract Dispute
- **HLX-10002-10002**: Alice Anderson - Shareholder Rights & Dispute Advice  
- **HLX-10003-10003**: Bob Bennett - Adjudication Advice & Dispute
- **HLX-10004-10004**: Sarah Worker - Employment Tribunal Representation

- **HLX-10008-10008**: Rebecca Globaltrader - International Commercial Litigation
- **HLX-27367-94842**: Luke Test - Health indicator (CRITICAL TO PRESERVE)
- **HLX-22338 series**: Shareholder dispute cases (4 records)
- **HLX-27367-51404**: Legitimate case with proper data

## ðŸš¨ Critical Execution Steps

### Step 1: Database Backup
```bash
# Create backup before ANY deletion
# (Execute appropriate backup command for your environment)
```

### Step 2: Verify Luke Test Preservation  
```sql
-- Confirm Luke Test record exists and won't be deleted
SELECT * FROM Instructions 
WHERE InstructionRef = 'HLX-27367-94842';

-- Expected: Luke Test, proof-of-id-complete, paid status
```

### Step 3: Execute Safe Cleanup
```sql
-- Main cleanup query - removes 29 test records, preserves Luke Test
DELETE FROM Instructions 
WHERE (
    -- Test payload patterns
    PaymentProduct LIKE '%Final test%'
    OR PaymentProduct LIKE '%Placeholder%' 
    OR PaymentProduct = 'test'
    
    -- Empty records
    OR (FirstName IS NULL AND LastName IS NULL AND PaymentProduct IS NULL)
    
    -- Test patterns in reference
    OR InstructionRef LIKE '%test%'
    OR InstructionRef = '27367-20200'
) 
-- CRITICAL: Preserve Luke Test health indicator
AND InstructionRef != 'HLX-27367-94842';
```

### Step 4: Verification
```sql
-- Confirm cleanup results
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as TotalRecords,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN InstructionRef = 'HLX-27367-94842' THEN 1 END) as LukeTestPreserved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN InstructionRef LIKE 'HLX-10%' THEN 1 END) as ProductionExamples
FROM Instructions;

-- Expected: ~15 total, 1 Luke Test, 7 production examples
```

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
```sql
-- Quick rollback verification
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Instructions;

-- If count is too low, restore from backup immediately
-- Expected post-cleanup count: ~15 records
```

### Recovery Strategy
1. **Immediate**: Restore from pre-cleanup backup
2. **Verify**: Check Luke Test record exists  
3. **Validate**: Confirm production examples intact
4. **Report**: Document any unexpected deletions

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

### Immediate Results (Post-Cleanup)
- **Record Count**: ~15 total (down from 45)
- **Luke Test**: Preserved and functional
- **Production Examples**: All 7 intact
- **UI Performance**: Improved loading speed
- **Demo Quality**: Professional, clean data

### Long-term Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Easier data management
- **User Experience**: Consistent, predictable interface
- **Training**: Clean examples for new users
- **Development**: Reliable test data patterns

## ðŸ›  Tools & Access

### Database Access Methods
1. **MSSQL Extension** (Recommended)
   - Server: `instructions.database.windows.net`
   - Use for direct SQL execution

2. **Node.js Scripts**
   - File: `scripts/cleanup-test-instructions.js`
   - May have connection issues

3. **Azure Portal**
   - Query editor for web-based access
   - Backup and restore capabilities

### Verification Commands
```sql
-- Quick health check
SELECT InstructionRef, FirstName, LastName, PaymentProduct 
FROM Instructions 
WHERE InstructionRef IN ('HLX-27367-94842', 'HLX-10001-10001')
ORDER BY InstructionRef;

-- Full result set preview
SELECT InstructionRef, FirstName, LastName 
FROM Instructions 
ORDER BY InstructionRef;
```

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Contacts

If cleanup causes issues:
1. **Immediate**: Restore from backup
2. **Document**: Record exactly what went wrong  
3. **Communicate**: Report to development team
4. **Monitor**: Check UI functionality post-restore
