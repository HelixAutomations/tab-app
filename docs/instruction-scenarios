# Data Seeding Scenarios

Below are five illustrative scenarios capturing the full range of states your local fixtures need to cover.  InstructionRefs are always in the form `HLX-5digit-5digit`.

---

## 1. Deal open, awaiting instruction

- **Deal**  
  - `DealId`: 10010  
  - `InstructionRef`: `NULL`  
  - `ProspectId`: 30010  
  - `Passcode`: `F30010`

    - `(DealJointClientId → DJC1001)`

- **Instruction** (`HLX-10011-10011`)  
  - Lead: paid (`card`/`successful`), two documents uploaded  
  - Joint: instruction received (`HLX-10011-10012`), no payment/docs required  
- **IDVerifications**  
  - Lead: all checks Passed  
  - Joint: record exists, overall result `Review`

  - Lead: `docA.pdf`, `docB.pdf`  
  - Joint: _none_

---

## 3. Lead + two joint clients, all complete

- **Deal**  
  - `DealId`: 10012  
  - `InstructionRef`: `HLX-10012-10012`  
  - `IsMultiClient`: `True`  
  - **Joint client count**: 2  

- **Instructions**  
  - Lead (`…-10012`): paid + two docs  
  - Joint #1 (`…-10013`), Joint #2 (`…-10014`): instruction received, no payment/docs

- **IDVerifications**  
  - Lead + both joints: all checks Passed  

- **Documents**  
  - Lead: two PDFs  
  - Joints: none

---

## 4. Payment failed, docs uploaded, no joint clients

- **Deal**  
  - `DealId`: 10013  
  - `InstructionRef`: `HLX-10013-10013`  
  - `IsMultiClient`: `False`

- **Instruction**  
  - Lead: payment attempted but `failed`  
  - Documents uploaded: two (e.g. `id.pdf`, `proof.pdf`)

- **IDVerifications**

## 5. Instruction only, no deal (no pitch)

  - Stage: `initialised`  
  - `PitchedBy`: _n/a_  
  - No payment/docs expected  
- **IDVerifications** (optional)  
  - May have one “Passed” verification if user provided ID, otherwise none  
- **Documents**: none

---

Next steps:

1. **TRUNCATE** target tables in the proper order (FKs off → delete → FKs on).  
2. **INSERT** data for each scenario, observing `IDENTITY_INSERT` where needed, and preserving referential integrity.  
3. Verify via the export script or API that each scenario appears exactly as above.
