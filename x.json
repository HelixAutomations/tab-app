    "EmailBody": "Hello Matthew,\n\nThank you for your enquiry and for your time on the phone earlier. It was good speaking with you.\n\nThe purpose of this email is to briefly follow up on our conversation which I hope you found useful. I’d love to assist you with this and consider we’re well placed to do so. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any queries, otherwise I have set out next steps below to assist you.\n\nWe have discussed that you have been and are in occupation of land for 30 years and your garages have been knocked down and Heatley Developments are trying to evict you. You consider the value of the dispute is likely to be around £200,000 to £600,000. I have initially commented that it will be helpful if pending my advice you can try and avoid any change to the position as to your occupation or possession of the land.<div><br></div><div>In terms of most appropriate next steps clearly there is some complexity here and we have discussed that I need to formally review and advise on the background, your current position and your best next steps.\n\nIn terms of costs, we record and bill for our time in 6-minute units, so one hour is 10 units. We charge for all steps and work, including emails in and out, and telephone calls. Partners record and bill at £395+VAT per hour, Associate Solicitors at £325 per hour, Solicitors at £285+VAT per hour, and Trainee Solicitors and Paralegals at £195+VAT per hour. Here, for the initial review and advice, you will need to budget in the region of approximately £3,000 + VAT. This is an estimate and not a fixed fee, but my hope and expectation is that at this stage, you will be clear on where you stand. We can then discuss the next steps at that stage. Further work will incur additional cost.\n\nPlease confirm your instructions by clicking <a href=\"https://instruct.helix-law.com/pitch/89801\" class=\"instruct-link\" style=\"color: #3690CE; text-decoration: underline;\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instruct Helix Law</a>. This single link will allow you to verify your identity, provide the key documents needed and provide funds on account of costs in a quick and transparent checkout process.\n\nOnce provided I will briefly review this to confirm our time and cost estimate is accurate and we will then open a file. At that stage you will receive our Client Care Letter formally confirming the terms of our retainer.\n\nI hope the above and our call have been useful and of course come back to me if I can help you further. I look forward to assisting you with this.</div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards</div>",
