 ## Styling
 
 The component relies on `componentTokens.card` exported from `src/app/styles/componentTokens.ts` which defines the base padding, border radius and hover shadow used across the instruction app. Additional animation rules are defined in `src/app/styles/InstructionCard.css`.
 
 Important styles include:
 
 - `padding: 20px` and `border-radius: 8px` for a neat card shape
 - `box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` with a stronger shadow on hover
 - `dropIn` keyframes so each card fades and slides into place
 
 By leveraging these tokens the instruction dashboard maintains a clean and high quality appearance that matches the existing design language.
 
 ## Action Points
 
 Below the details list the card includes an "Action Points" section. This lists
 instruction‑specific tasks such as the electronic ID check status and the most
 recent risk assessment result so solicitors can quickly see what work remains.
 The action list sits beneath a divider at the bottom of the card.
 
 Below the action list the card exposes three actions as tabs positioned along
 the bottom edge. The currently selected tab expands to reveal its label while
 the other two shrink to just their icons. The tabs appear in the order
-**Verify an ID**, **Risk Assessment**, and finally **Open Matter** to guide users
+**Verify an ID**, **Assess Risk**, and finally **Open Matter** to guide users
 through each step in sequence.
