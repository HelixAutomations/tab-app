    is wrapped in a `data-sentence` span which is `contenteditable`, allowing
    quick tweaks without affecting the rest of the block. A small × icon before
    each sentence lets you remove it entirely with one click if it is not
    required.
 
 ## Scrapping content
 
 - Each block includes a delete icon to remove it from the editor.
 - The × icon on every sentence allows you to discard individual lines without
   affecting the rest of the block.
 - The *Clear* button removes all inserted blocks and restores the original
   placeholders.
 
 These controls make it easy to experiment with different blocks or remove them
 completely before sending the final email.
 
 ## Snippet edit workflow
 
 The snippet library now supports a more robust editing process:
 
 * Each proposed change may include updated label, sort order or even a new block assignment. Setting `IsNew` allows a brand new snippet to be added for review.
 * Allowed edit statuses (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`) are enforced via a lookup table so typos cannot slip into the database.
 * Approvers can capture reasons in a `ReviewNotes` column when accepting or rejecting an edit.
 * Every time a snippet is approved the prior version is stored in `SimplifiedBlockSnippetVersions` along with its version number.
 
-These upgrades make it easier to refine the library over time while preserving a full history of changes.

+## UI prompts for edits
+
+The editor surfaces editing tools directly within each block. Selecting the block label opens an edit modal where snippet text, label and sort order can be modified. Pending changes appear in the **Snippet Edits** pane and approvers see a notification badge when new edits require review. Proposed snippets flagged with `IsNew` are highlighted so reviewers know they will create additional library entries once approved.
