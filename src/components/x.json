And the builders they used didn't seem professional and worked in heavy rain. \\nI also seek compensation for damages delays and all other aspects. They Did agree to 15k but refusing it now. \\n \\nRegards\\nArslan\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDear Sir or Madam,\\nI am writing to formally address ongoing issues with the external wall insulation (EWI) work carried out at my property, 12 Newark Road, Luton, LU4 8LD, under a government grant scheme, by Elansworth LTD/NextRecycle. Despite multiple complaints over the past nearly three years, the work remains incomplete, substandard, and has caused significant damage to my property. Furthermore, the company has failed to honor a written agreement to pay £15,000 in compensation for these issues, as confirmed via WhatsApp by the owner, who has since blocked my number and ignored further communications. As this has not been met in reasonable manner of time, I will be seeking my further rights in compensation etc. \\nDetails of the Complaint\\nIncomplete and Substandard Work\\n: The EWI project, initiated nearly three years ago, remains unfinished despite repeated complaints. The contractors have performed partial work on multiple occasions, leaving the job incomplete and of poor quality, failing to meet industry standards.\\nProperty Damage\\n: During the course of the work, my property sustained damages.\\nLack of Documentation\\n: No plans, drawings, or material specifications were provided for the EWI work, leaving me without clarity on the scope or standards of the project.\\nUnqualified Personnel\\n: On at least one occasion, a non-registered gas engineer was sent to perform work, with a registered engineer following up later, indicating non-compliance with regulatory requirements.\\nInvalid Guarantee\\n: Provided guarantee paperwork over two years ago that was not signed off, reflecting incomplete work. Despite assurances that new guarantee paperwork would be issued, this has not been fulfilled. \\nInadequate Assessments\\n: Multiple assessors visited my property but failed to follow proper procedures, further delaying resolution.\\nUnfulfilled Compensation Agreement\\n: The owner agreed via WhatsApp to pay £15,000 in compensation for the issues caused. However, have since blocked my number and failed to honor this agreement.\\nThis letter outlines the primary issues with the work performed. I reserve the right to raise additional claims as necessary\\n \\nI have raised these concerns directly with Elansworth LTD/NextRecycle via email and WhatsApp, as well as with NAPIT, the relevant certification body. Despite these efforts, no meaningful progress has been made to resolve the issues or honor the agreed compensation.\\n·\\n  \\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, I am entitled to services performed with reasonable care and skill, which your company has failed to provide.\\n·\\n \\nNotice of Legal Action\\nShould you fail to respond satisfactorily or meet these demands within 7 days of the date of this letter (by July 16, 2025), I will have no choice but to escalate this matter. This may include, but is not limited to: \\n·\\n  \\nFiling a claim in the County Court for breach of contract, negligence, and damages.\\nReporting the company to relevant authorities, including Trading Standards, the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme administrators, and other regulatory bodies overseeing government-funded insulation schemes.\\nSeeking further legal advice to pursue compensation for all losses incurred, including additional costs for remedial work and legal fees.\\n \\nResponse Requested\\nPlease confirm receipt of this letter and provide a written response addressing my demands by July 16, 2025. You may contact me via email. Failure to respond or resolve this matter promptly will result in further action without additional notice.\\nI trust you will treat this matter with the urgency and seriousness it warrants.\\n \\nYours sincerely,\\nArslan Shamrez\\n12 Newark Road\\nLuton\\nLU4 8LD",

    "notes": "Hi\\n\\nI am seeking legal representation for a civil claim conservatively valued in excess of £400,000 against my brother, relating to serious breaches of trust, fiduciary duty, misrepresentation, and deceit. The dispute concerns our jointly owned dental practice and its associated property at 91 Woodlands Close, Clacton-on-Sea.\\n\\nMy 50% beneficial interest in both the business and the property is confirmed by a signed partnership agreement dated 15 January 2015, along with multiple written reaffirmations between 2024 and 2025. I also contributed over 20 years of substantial unpaid professional work—as co-owner—in business management, planning and development, marketing, IT, digital systems, and staff management, further reinforcing my equitable stake.\\n\\nIn December 2024, the business was sold and the property leased without my knowledge or consent. Despite repeated formal requests, I have been denied access to transactional details and rental income. I’ve also found the buyer and his solicitor and warned them against knowing receipt of disputed property.\\n\\nI believe this claim has strong legal merit, is well-documented, and is financially viable under a Conditional Fee Agreement, especially as the leased property continues to generate income and is recoverable.\\n\\nGiven the value of the claim and the substantial supporting and documentary evidence, I wish to proceed on a No Win No Fee basis. However, due to financial constraints imposed by my brother’s actions, I am currently unable to fund any legal reviews or consultations.\\nCould you please confirm whether your firm offers a free preliminary assessment of CFA eligibility before requiring any fees?\\n\\nI have attached:\\n\\n•\\tA formal written request (LBA) that I sent to my brother, dated 30 January 2025; and\\n\\n•\\tA formal letter, dated 5 February 2025, which I issued to the buyer, my brother, and their solicitors involved in the sale/lease, warning them against the knowing receipt of disputed property.\\n\\nShould it assist with your assessment, I am happy to provide a detailed case summary along with any additional documentary evidence.\\n\\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.",
