  Assuming that you can evidence the position above, then there are likely to be the following causes of action.
   
  It is vital that we work together to strategically position you around the following key areas:
  
  X
  Y
  Z
   
  I am experienced in dealing with this type of issue and am happy to assist you and the key is from this point on to carefully position you so that you are in a sufficiently strong position that you can force the Defendants to reach a sensible commercial settlement or if they will not do so proceed to court and obtain the same or a better result, while of course putting you in the best possible position to recover the costs you incur in the litigation from them.
  
  In the context of a dispute worth in the high hundreds of thousands or millions, from a cost v benefit analysis, my initial view is it stacks up for you to incur the costs for the initial review below.`,

  This will require an initial review of core documents such as the contract and taking your instructions around the actions taken to devalue the company, as well as where appropriate, pinning down the stated position on Y. I then anticipate being able to provide initial advice on your current position and best next steps.
  
  We charge on a time recorded basis and record all time in 6 minute units. This includes for emails in and out and telephone attendances, and all steps on your behalf. I am a [INSERT] and my hourly rate is £[INSERT] + VAT. We work as a team and a number of colleagues may assist in relation to various steps in relation to your matter, at different times. Their time will be recorded and charged on the basis of their hourly rates as applicable from time to time – these are all lower than £395+VAT.
  
  For the initial work and review above you will need to budget in the region of approximately [Amount] + VAT. This is an estimate and not a fixed fee; the cost will ultimately depend on the time spent including the scale of documents and enquiries received from you, but based on my experience this is likely to be an accurate estimate at this stage. If it takes less time we will of course bill you less.
  
  Further work will incur additional costs on a time basis and in a fully litigated dispute it is not unusual for each party to incur costs of tens of thousands of pounds in this type of dispute, if not higher. Costs will of course be a concern, naturally.
  
  Equally, if you are positioned to win a dispute you can usually expect to recover in the region of approximately 65-70% of your costs (if not higher). In this context the fear of being ordered to pay your costs can provide powerful leverage to force resolution of a dispute in your favour. We will of course consider this within our initial review and work as above.`,

  This will require an initial review of core documents such as [INSERT the contracts, notices, demands, accounts, relevant correspondence set out below] so that we can be as clear as possible on the factual position with companies house and land registry.

  To assist me in completing the review if you can please provide a copy of the shareholders agreement (if any), Directors service agreement (if any), copies of the recent correspondence you have received and sent, and a brief summary over no more than 2 pages of the current position. It is fine to use bullet points within an email for this if you prefer.

  It is usually important to act quickly in this type of situation to force or avoid a winding up petition being issued. When a petition is issued all company bank accounts are immediately frozen which can have a catastrophic impact on a business for obvious reasons. A quick and robust approach is therefore needed to force resolution.
