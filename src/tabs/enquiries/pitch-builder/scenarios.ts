    body: `Thank you for your enquiry to Helix Law. We’re a specialist firm of solicitors and we only dealt with litigation and disputes. We act nationally. Before taking things further it is obviously incredibly important that you consider cost; benefit, and that it stacks up for you and for us for you to incur legal costs. With this in mind I have set out below some details that I hope help in relation to your enquiry so that you make a decision before we go ahead with a call or a paid review and advice.

We haven’t yet spoken but I have reviewed the details and information you have helpfully provided, thank you. You appear to be in a dispute with [INSERT] relating to [INSERT] and you have confirmed that [INSERT].

The dispute with [INSERT] creates difficulty for obvious reasons and you have asked [INSERT].
